KSL Cars Plus
=============

A Chrome extension that improves KSL cars.

## To build the extension:
 - git clone this repository
 - ```cd ksl-cars-plus```
 - ```npm install```
 - ```npm run build```
 
## To install the extension locally:
 - Navigate to chrome://extensions
 - Check the "Developer mode" checkbox
 - Click "Load unpacked extension..."
 - Browse to the ksl-cars-plus folder (where you git cloned it)

## To hack on the extension:
 - Make sure "npm run build" is running
 - Make your changes
 - Go to chrome://extensions and refresh the page (why is this necessary? this sucks)
 - Go to a KSL cars page and refresh it
